upgrade:
  - |
    The :func:`.transpile` function has been upgraded to, in most cases,
    internally convert transpiler constraints into a :class:`.Target` instance. 
    If a `backend` input of type :class:`.BackendV1` is provided, it will be 
    converted to :class:`.BackendV2` to expose its :class:`.Target` to the pass manager. 
    This change does not require any user action.
