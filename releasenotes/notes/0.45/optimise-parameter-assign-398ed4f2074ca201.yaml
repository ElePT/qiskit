    A new method :meth:`.Parameter.assign` has been added that primarily serves as a fast path to improves the performance of
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters` for the common case of circuits that contain
    predominantly "expressions" that are actually just single parameters to be assigned later.
