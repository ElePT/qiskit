    We are pleased to release Qiskit 2.0.0, with 
    new features that improve performance and expand Qiskit's capabilities.
    In line with our semantic versioning policy, documented a the time of 
    the 1.0.0 release, this major release also includes API changes that 
    are not backward-compatible with the 1.x series. 
    
    The feature highlights of Qiskit 2.0.0 are:

    * The introduction of a C API for building and interacting with
      :class:`.SparseObservable` objects. This marks Qiskit's first 
      compiled language interface, an experimental feature that we will 
      fine-tune and grow in scope throughout the 2.x series.
    * The ability to create stretch durations for :class:`.Delay` instructions.
      This expands the existing set of classical variable expressions in Qiskit.
    * Improved runtime performance for circuit construction and transpilation.

    As for API changes, this release removes several deprecated components of the Qiskit
    data model, such as the ``.c_if()`` method, ``BackendV1``, and ``qiskit.pulse``, as 
    well as the deprecated  V1 primitive reference implementations.
    You can refer to the upgrade release notes sections for more details on all of
    these removals and API changes. The removed APIs are still supported in the Qiskit 1.4.x
    release which will recieve bugfixes for another 6 months and will have security
    updates for one year.
