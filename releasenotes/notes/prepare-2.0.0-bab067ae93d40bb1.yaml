    We are pleased to release Qiskit 2.0.0, with 
    new features that improve performance and expand Qiskit's capabilities.
    The feature highlights of Qiskit 2.0.0 include:

    * The introduction of a C API for building and interacting with
      :class:`.SparseObservable` objects. This will be Qiskit's first 
      compiled language interface, an experimental feature that we will 
      fine-tune and grow in scope throughout the 2.x series.
    * The ability to create stretch durations for :class:`.Delay` instructions.
      This expands the existing set of classical variable expressions in Qiskit
      for advanced compilation routines.
    * Support for synthesis using fractional basis gates,
      significantly reducing gate counts in elegible circuits (see 
      https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/fractional-gates).
    * Improved runtime performance, particularly for the circuit construction step,
      where benchpress shows a 2x speedup over Qiskit 1.3.

    In line with our semantic versioning policy, documented a the time of 
    the 1.0.0 release, this major release also includes API changes that 
    are not backward-compatible with the 1.x series. 
    In particular, several deprecated components of the Qiskit data model have
    been removed, such as the ``.c_if()`` method, ``BackendV1``, and ``qiskit.pulse``, as 
    well as the deprecated  V1 primitive reference implementations.
    You can refer to the upgrade release notes sections for more details on all of
    these removals and API changes. The removed APIs are still supported in the Qiskit 1.4.x
    release which will receive bugfixes for another 6 months and will have security
    updates for one year.
