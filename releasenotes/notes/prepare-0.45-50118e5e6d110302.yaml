  The Qiskit Terra 0.45.0 release highlights are:

  * We have introduced two new classes: :class:`.SingletonInstruction` (subclass of :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`)
    and :class:`~.SingletonGate` (subclass of :class:`~.Gate`). These classes use a single instance for all objects
    of that type, reducing the memory and construction overhead of using multiple gates in a circuit. The tradeoff,
    however, is that they have a global shared state, which is incompatible with gates that have unique and/or
    mutable states stored in an instance. See feature notes for more details.

  * We have added a new :mod:`qiskit.passmanager` module. This module implements a generic pass manager and
    flow controllers, and provides infrastructure to manage execution of pass manager tasks. The generic
    pass manager was also used to rebuild the existing pass manager in the :mod:`qiskit.transpiler` module.
    See feature and upgrade notes for more details.

  * We have also designed the :class:`~.AnnotatedOperation` class, which allows to formulate complex circuit
    instructions as a base instruction with a set of modifiers. For example, instead of a specific operation
    type that implements the controlled inverse of a :class:`~.RXGate`, we can now use an annotated
    :class:`~.RXGate` with inverse and control attributes.
