    Fixed a bug in meth :class:`.qpy.load` that would fail to deserialize
    the :class:`.PauliFeatureMap` class because of a clash of parameter
    names in the parameter expression replay. This clash was only seen when
    handling certain instances of :class:`.NLocal` such as 
    :class:`.PauliFeatureMap` or :class:`.ZZFeatureMap`.
    Fixed `#13720 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13720>`__.
