features:
  - |
     Added :class:`qiskit.algorithms.eigensolvers` package to include
     interfaces for primitive-enabled algorithms. Refactored
     :class:`qiskit.algorithms.eigensolvers.VQD` to leverage primitives.
deprecations:
  - |
     :class:`qiskit.algorithms.eigen_solvers` package will now issue a ``PendingDeprecationWarning``. It
     will be deprecated in a future release and subsequently removed after that. This is being
     replaced by the new :class:`qiskit.algorithms.eigensolvers` package that will host
     primitive-enabled algorithms.
