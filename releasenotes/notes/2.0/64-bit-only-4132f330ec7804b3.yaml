    Qiskit no longer supports Linux i686 and 32-bit Windows. Starting in Qiskit
    v2.0.0, a 64-bit platform is required to run Qiskit. The user base for 32-bit
    architectures is relatively small, and as Qiskit continues to focus on
    improving performance to handle the increased scale in the complexity
    of quantum computing hardware, maintaining support for 32-bit platforms
    has become increasingly difficult. 
    This, coupled with the larger scientific Python community's trend 
    away from 32-bit platform support, makes maintaining support for 32-bit 
    platforms no longer viable.
    Qiskit v1.x will continue to support 32-bit platforms, but starting with 
    this 2.0.0 release, Qiskit no longer supports these platforms, will no 
    longer publish pre-compiled binaries for them, and offers no guarantee of 
    successful source builds on 32-bit platforms.
