    Fixed a bug in :meth:`.RZGate.control`, which applied
    an unnecessarily expensive decomposition for more than one control qubit.
    Fixed `#13473 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13473>`__.

    The generic ``control`` method for gates  (for example, :meth:`.RZGate.control`) 
    now avoids attempting to translate gates into a supported basis if the gate is already supported. 
    This can slightly change the synthesis of the controlled gate, although it should not increase the 
    two-qubit gate count.
