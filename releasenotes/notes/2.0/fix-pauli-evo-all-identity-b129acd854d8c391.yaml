    Fixed a bug in the class :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`, where using a product formula synthesis (the default)
    did not correctly handle all-identity terms in the operator. The all-identity term should introduce a 
    global phase equal to ``-evolution_time``, but was previously off by a factor of 2 and could break 
    for parameterized times.
    Fixed `#13625 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13625>`__.
