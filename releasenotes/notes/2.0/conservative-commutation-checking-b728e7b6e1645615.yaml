    Fixed an unexpected behavior in :class:`.CommutationChecker`, where
    commutation relations of :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`\ s with float-only params
    were eagerly cached using parameters as the key to query the relation.

    This could lead to incorrect results if an instruction's definition depended on
    additional information beyond the :attr:`~.circuit.Instruction.params` attribute,
    as is the case for :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`.

    This behavior has now been corrected. The commutation checker now conservatively
    caches commutations only for Qiskit-native standard gates. This may incur a performance 
    cost if you relied on caching for custom gates; however,
    safe caching for custom gates cannot be guaranteed, as they may depend on
    information beyond :attr:`~.circuit.Instruction.params`.

    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.CommmutationChecker`, where checking commutation of instruction
    with non-numeric values in the :attr:`~.circuit.Instruction.params` attribute (such as the
    :class:`.PauliGate`) could raise an error.
    Fixed `#13570 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13570>`__.
