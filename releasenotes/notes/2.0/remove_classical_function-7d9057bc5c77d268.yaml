    The :mod:`.classical_function` module has been removed. This module was dependent on the
    ``tweedledum`` library which is no longer compatible with newer versions of Python.
    As an alternative, the :class:`.PhaseOracleGate` and :class:`.BitFlipOracleGate` classes
    can be used to generate circuits from boolean expressions.
