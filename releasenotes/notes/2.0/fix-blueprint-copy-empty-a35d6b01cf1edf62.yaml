    :meth:`.BlueprintCircuit.copy_empty_like` now returns an empty :class:`.QuantumCircuit` 
    with the same number of qubits/clbits and the same metadata as the original circuit, instead 
    of a :class:`.BlueprintCircuit`. This change addresses unexpected behavior where dealing with 
    an "empty" copy of a blueprint circuit would cause the circuit data to be rebuilt.
    Note that :meth:`.BlueprintCircuit.copy` still returns a :class:`.BlueprintCircuit`.
    Fixed `#13535 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13535>`__
