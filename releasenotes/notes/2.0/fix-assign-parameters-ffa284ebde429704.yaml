    Fixed an incorrect behavior in :class:`.CircuitData` in which, upon parameter assignment,
    Qiskit attempted to modify the cached operation inside of a ``PackedInstruction``. Now,
    the cache is discarded instead, which prompts ``PackedInstruction`` to build a new Python
    operation if it is needed.
