    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass, where blocks of
    :class:`.UnitaryGate`\s on three or more qubits were not correctly synthesized.
    This led,for example, to the circuit being overwritten by the last processed block or
    to internal panics when encountering measurements after such a block.
    Fixed `#13586 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13586>`__.
