features_synthesis:
  - |
    Add a :class:`.TwoQubitControlledUDecomposer` that decomposes any two-qubit unitary
    in terms of basis two-qubit fractional gates, such as :class:`.RZZGate`
    (or two-gates gates which are locally equivalent to :class:`.RZZGate` up to single qubit gates).
features_transpiler:
  - |
    Add two-qubit fractional basis gates, such as :class:`.RZZGate`, to the
    :class:`.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass.
