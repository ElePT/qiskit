    The Pulse deprecation in Qiskit v1.3.0, included calibration builder passes
    such as :class:`.RXCalibrationBuilder`. The
    :class:`.NormalizeRXAngle` pass is a requirement of :class:`.RXCalibrationBuilder`;
    hence, it is being deprecated in Qiskit v1.4.0. The :func:`.rzx_templates`
    function in the calibration module is also being deprecated as it is not used in our codebase.
