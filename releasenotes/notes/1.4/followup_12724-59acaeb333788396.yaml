    The signature of the argument ``atomic_evolution`` in the constructor of the classes
    :class:`.LieTrotter`, :class:`.ProductFormula`, and 
    :class:`.SuzukiTrotter` was modified in Qiskit v1.2.0 to improve the visualization
    of the output circuit. The older signature has now been deprecated in favor of the 
    new alternative. From Qiskit 2.0.0, only the new alternative will be valid.

    To migrate, please modify the callable from
    ``Callable[[Pauli | SparsePauliOp, float], QuantumCircuit]`` to
    ``Callable[[QuantumCircuit, Pauli | SparsePauliOp, float], None]``.
