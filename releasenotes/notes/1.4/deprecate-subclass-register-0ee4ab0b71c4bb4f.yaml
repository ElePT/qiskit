    It is now deprecated to subclass :class:`.Register` or :class:`.Bit`, or any subclass of them
    (for example, :class:`.QuantumRegister` or :class:`~.circuit.Qubit`).  Subclassing these types
    was never explicitly supported by Qiskit, and it is not clear precisely what the meaning would

    be.  In Qiskit 2.0, the subclassing may become impossible due to technical limitations, and will
    certainly not be stored in a circuit.  This is because of the move of the data model to Rust
    space to improve performance.
