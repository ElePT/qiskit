    Subclassing :class:`.Register` or :class:`.Bit`, or any subclass of them
    (for example, :class:`.QuantumRegister` or :class:`~.circuit.Qubit`) is deprecated as of Qiskit v1.4.0.  
    Subclassing these types was never explicitly supported by Qiskit, and its meaning was never defined.
    In Qiskit v2.0.0, the subclassing may become impossible due to technical limitations, 
    and will certainly not be stored in a circuit.  This is due to the move of the data model 
    to the Rust space to improve performance.
