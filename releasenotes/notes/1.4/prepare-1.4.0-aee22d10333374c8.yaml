    The Qiskit v1.4.0 release is the final minor version release for the 1.x series.
    This release primarily adds new deprecation warnings for API changes coming
    in the future major version release 2.0.0. It is fully compatible with the
    Qiskit 1.3.x releases. It is strongly recommended that you upgrade from
    1.3.x to 1.4.0 so that you're able to see the warnings about which
    interfaces will change with Qiskit 2.0.0.
    The 1.4.x release series will continue to be supported and recieve
    bugfix and security fixes via patch releases for 6 months after this
    release. For more details on the release schedule and support cycle
