    The :meth:`.BasicSimulator.run_experiment` method has been deprecated 
    and will be removed in Qiskit v2.0.0.
    The method takes a :class:`.QasmQobjExperiment` as input argument, 
    which has been deprecated together
    with the :class:`.Qobj` class and other related functionality. 
    You can call :meth:`.BasicSimulator.run` 
    with a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` input instead.
