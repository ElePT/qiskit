features:
  - |
     Added :class:`qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers` package to include
     interfaces for primitive-enabled algorithms. Refactored
     :class:`qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.VQE` to leverage primitives.
     Please see the Qiskit Runtime migration guide for more information.
deprecations:
  - |
     :class:`qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigen_solvers` package will now issue a
     ``PendingDeprecationWarning``. It will be deprecated in a future release and subsequently
     removed after that. This is being replaced by the new
     :class:`qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers` package that will host primitive-enabled
     algorithms.
