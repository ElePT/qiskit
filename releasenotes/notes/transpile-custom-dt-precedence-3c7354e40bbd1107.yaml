    The :class:`.TimeUnitConversion` transformation pass now gives precedence to the ``inst_durations``
    argument over the ``target`` argument. This fixes an unexpected behavior in :meth:`.transpile` where
    custom ``dt`` inputs would be ignored if a ``target`` was provided too (directly or as part of a 
    :class:`.BackendV2` instance).
