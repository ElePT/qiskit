    The :meth:`.BasicSimulator.run_experiment` method has been deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit 2.0.0.
    The method takes :class:`.QasmQobjExperiment` as input argument, which has been deprecated together
    with the :class:`.Qobj` class and other related functionality. You can call :meth:`.BasicSimulator.run` 
    with a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` input instead.
