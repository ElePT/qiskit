    A bug in :func:`.transpile` has been fixed where custom `instruction_durations` and `dt` constraints
    would be ignored when provided at the same time as a backend of type :class:`.BackendV2`. The behavior
    after the fix is now independent of whether the provided backend is of type :class:`.BackendV1` or
    type :class:`.BackendV2`.
